This directory is meant to hold the Doxygen documentation.
As it is way to big to be uploaded on the svn, we only commit the Doxygen configuration file.
However, if you want to have it locally, you can install the doxygen package and run this command :
 $ doxygen wired.doxy
in the parent directory.

This documentation is also available at : http://wired.is.free.fr/doxygen/
