==COMMON USAGE PROBLEMS==
1- "Could not open audio device ..."

First, you should check your audio settings... ;-)
To do so, in the menu 'Edit', choose 'Settings...'. Then go to the Audio section.
In the Output subsection, choose a sound card, make sure two outputs are checked.
Then go back to the main audio section and select a samplerate and a latency. 
The '4096 Samples/buffer' is known to be unstable on some configurations. 
Please, try to avoid it.

If it still doesn't work, or if you can't find any soundcard in the list, it may 
be because you are using ALSA and another software is already using your 
soundcard. Close every audio applications and try to relaunch wired.

You can try to use fuser to check if a command is using your audio devices.
$ fuser -v /dev/dsp
should make it in most cases, but you can replace /dev/dsp with the appropriate 
device, depending on your configuration. 

You should also ty to delete you wired.conf (~/.wired/wired.conf) file since it
may be outdated. Then close all audio application and try to launch Wired again
and configure you sound card. A new configuration file will be created
automatically.
