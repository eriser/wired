This document contains installation notes and installation problems resolutions. 
If, after having read it carefully, you still cannot install Wired, please 
consider reporting in the user forum : http://wired.sf.net/

==DEPENDENCIES==
Before trying to compile Wired, you should make sure you have the following 
packages installed on your system. They are Wired's direct dependancies and they 
may need other dependancies not listed here. We cannot encourage you enough to 
use your distribution's package system as it, most of the time, handles 
those dependancies problems.

  - ALSA support in your kernel and alsalib installed 
      http://www.alsa-project.org
	* Kernels 2.6.x have integrated ALSA support
	* You can download alsalib and latest card drivers at :

  - libxml2
    http://xmlsoft.org/
    * or you can install it with 1 package: libxml2-dev

  - wxGTK 2.6.x 
      http://www.wxwidgets.org
	* When compiling wxWidgets, be sure you are using GTK2 support by 
	passing to configure script: --enable-gtk2
	* or you can install it with 2 packages: libwxgtk2.6-dev, wx-common

  - SoundTouch: 
      http://sky.prohosting.com/oparviai/soundtouch/
	* You have to make sure SoundTouch uses float samples instead of integer 
	samples.
	To do so, follow these steps :
	  - go to the SoundTouch sources directory
	  - open the file include/STTypes.h
	  - find line "#define INTEGER_SAMPLES" and COMMENT it
	  - find line "#define FLOAT_SAMPLES" and UNCOMMENT it
	  - now you can compile and install SoundTouch
	* or you can install it with 1 package: libsoundtouch1-dev

  - libsndfile 
      http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/
      * You can install it with 1 package: libsndfile1-dev

  - libsamplerate
      http://www.mega-nerd.com/SRC/
       * You can install it with 1 package: libsamplerate0-dev

  - dssi 
      http://dssi.sourceforge.net/
        * This is only useful if you want to have dssi plugins integrated.
	However, it is highly reccomended as these are great plugins.
       * You can install it with 1 package: dssi-dev

  - FLAC++
	http://flac.sourceforge.net/
	* You can install it with 1 package: libflac++-dev

  - Vorbis
	http://www.vorbis.com/
	* You can install it with 1 package: libvorbis-dev


==COMPILATION==
The easy way is as follow.

$ ./autogen.sh
$ ./configure
$ make
$ su
Password:
$ make install

If everything has went well, you should be able to type wired in a console to 
start enjoying Wired.
If this doesn't work, there are a few known compilation problems.


==KNOWN COMPILATION ERRORS==

1- Global considerations

The configure script is there, among things, to check for your configuration to 
be ready to receive Wired. However, you should check for its output. It should 
print a summary of the informations it found when it is done. Make sure each 
dependency is followed by a version number and that each option is followed by 
the correct setting. 

2- Error in LoopSampler

If you have an error looking like
   "error: no matching function for call to `SoundTouch::receiveSamples(float*, 
   long int)'",
Make sure you made the modifications needed to SoundTouch header. Please read 
carefully the DEPENDENCIES section

3- Cannot find shared library at launch

If you have an error looking like "wired: error while loading shared libraries: 
libWiredWidgets.so.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory",
the problem comes from the fact that wired was installed in your /usr/local/ 
directory and your system tries to find the libraries in /usr.
There are two ways two solve this problems, install Wired in /usr or tell you 
system to look for libraries in /usr/local/.

Solution 1 :
pass --prefix=/usr to the configure script

Solution2 :
$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib
$ wired

You can also add the export command to your .bashrc so you won't have to type it 
each time.

However solution one should prefer as long as it is possible.
