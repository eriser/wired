* Wired installation notes*

You need to follow some important notes before being able to compile Wired.
Please read them below :

--- Wired requires several libraries you need to install before compiling it:

  - ALSA support in your kernel and alsalib installed 
	* Kernels 2.6.x have integrated ALSA support
	* You can download alsalib and latest card drivers at :
	http://www.alsa-project.org

  - GTK 2 : http://www.gtk.org

  - wxGTK 2.6.x : www.wxwidgets.org
	* When compiling wxWidgets, be sure you are using GTK2 support by 
	passing to configure script: --enable-gtk2

  - Latest CVS snapshot of PortAudio v19 
	* You should be able to download it from:
	http://portaudio.com/archives/pa_snapshot_v19.tar.gz
	* We recommend to compile with ALSA support (--with-alsa) and without 
	JACK since jack support hasn't been really tested.

  - SoundTouch: http://sky.prohosting.com/oparviai/soundtouch/
	* /!\ VERY IMPORTANT /!\
	You need to modify a SoundTouch header before compiling and installing,
	in order to use float samples instead of integers:
	  - open the file SoundTouch/include/STTypes.h
	  - find line "#define INTEGER_SAMPLES" and COMMENT it
	  - find line "#define FLOAT_SAMPLES" and UNCOMMENT it
	  - now you can compile and install SoundTouch

  - libsndfile : http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/

  - libsamplerate (at least 0.1) : http://www.mega-nerd.com/SRC/download.html

  - dssi-0.9 : http://dssi.sourceforge.net/download.html
