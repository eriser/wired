This document contains installation notes and installation problems resolutions. 
If, after reading it carefully, you still can't install Wired, please 
consider reporting to the user forum : http://wired.sf.net/

==DEPENDENCIES==
Before trying to compile Wired, you should make sure you have the following 
packages installed on your system. They are Wired's direct dependancies and they 
may need other dependancies not listed here. We cannot encourage you enough to 
use your distribution's package system as it, most of the time, handles 
those dependancies problems.

  - ALSA support in your kernel and alsalib installed 
      http://www.alsa-project.org
	* Kernels 2.6.x have integrated ALSA support
	* You also need alsa-headers to compile on debian

  - gettext
      http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/gettext.html    
        * or you can install it with 1 package: gettext

  - cvs (in order to use 'autopoint')
      http://www.cvshome.org/
	* or you can install it with 1 package: cvs

  - autotools,libtool (autoconf and automake)
      http://www.gnu.org/

  - SoundTouch: 
      http://sky.prohosting.com/oparviai/soundtouch/
	* You have to make sure SoundTouch uses float samples instead of integer 
	samples.
	To do so, follow these steps :
	  - go to the SoundTouch sources directory
	  - open the file include/STTypes.h
	  - find line "#define INTEGER_SAMPLES" and COMMENT it
	  - find line "#define FLOAT_SAMPLES" and UNCOMMENT it
	  - now you can compile and install SoundTouch
	* or you can install it with 1 package: libsoundtouch1-dev
        * OPTIONAL: can be disabled with --disable-plugins (discouraged)

  - FLAC++
	http://flac.sourceforge.net/
	* You can install it with 1 package: libflac++-dev

musician would compose digitally.

==COMPILATION==
The easy way is as follows.

$ ./autogen.sh
$ ./configure
$ make
$ su
Password:
$ make install

If everything went well, you should be able to launch wired just by typing
"wired" in a console. If this doesn't work, there are a few known compilations.


==KNOWN COMPILATION ERRORS==

1- Global considerations

The configure script is there, among things, to check your configuration.
However, you should check for its output. It should print a summary of the
informations it found when it is done. Make sure each dependency is followed
by a version number and that each option is followed by the correct setting. 

2- Error in LoopSampler

If you have an error looking like
   "error: no matching function for call to `SoundTouch::receiveSamples(float*, 
   long int)'",
Make sure you made the modifications needed to SoundTouch header. Please read 
carefully the DEPENDENCIES section

3- Cannot find shared library at launch

If you have an error looking like "wired: error while loading shared libraries: 
libWiredWidgets.so.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory",
the problem comes from the fact that wired was installed in your /usr/local/ 
directory and your system tries to find the libraries in /usr.
There are two ways two solve this problem, install Wired in /usr or tell your 
system to look for libraries in /usr/local/.

Solution 1 :
pass the "--prefix=/usr" argument to the configure script

Solution2 :
$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib
$ wired

You can also add the export command to your .bashrc so you won't have to type it 
each time.

However solution one should be prefered as long as it is possible.
