* Wired installation notes*

You need to follow some important notes before being able to compile Wired.
Please read them below :

--- Wired requires several libraries you need to install before compiling it:

  - ALSA support in your kernel and alsalib installed 
	* Kernels 2.6.x have integrated ALSA support
	* You can download alsalib and latest card drivers at :
	http://www.alsa-project.org

  - GTK 2 : http://www.gtk.org

  - wxGTK 2.6.x (recommended 2.6.1 or 2.6.2) : www.wxwidgets.org
	* When compiling wxWidgets, be sure you are using GTK2 support by 
	passing to configure script: --enable-gtk2

  - Latest CVS snapshot of PortAudio v19 
	* You should be able to download it from:
	http://portaudio.com/archives/pa_snapshot_v19.tar.gz
	* We recommend to compile with ALSA support (--with-alsa) and without 
	JACK since jack support hasn't been really tested.

  - SoundTouch: http://sky.prohosting.com/oparviai/soundtouch/
	* /!\ VERY IMPORTANT /!\
	You need to modify a SoundTouch header before compiling and installing,
	in order to use float samples instead of integers:
	  - open the file SoundTouch/include/STTypes.h
	  - find line "#define INTEGER_SAMPLES" and COMMENT it
	  - find line "#define FLOAT_SAMPLES" and UNCOMMENT it
	  - now you can compile and install SoundTouch

  - libsndfile : http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/

  - libsamplerate (at least 0.1) : http://www.mega-nerd.com/SRC/download.html

  - dssi-0.9 : http://dssi.sourceforge.net/download.html

	- Error in AudioEngine, such as : 
./engine/AudioEngine.h:87: error: `PaDeviceIndex' was not declared in this scope 
	* You have an old PortAudio v18 version installed. 
	Wired requires latest v19

	- Error in LoopSampler, such as :
error: no matching function for call to `SoundTouch::receiveSamples(float*, long int)' 
	* You didn't made the modifications needed to SoundTouch header, please read
	section above about required libraries.

	- Error in a wxWidgets statement :
	* Some problems have been reported with some systems, but the following 
	configurations have been tested to work :
	  - wxGTK 2.5.0 with GTK 2.2 and GCC 3.3.x
	  - wxGTK 2.5.3 with GTK 2.4 and GCC 3.4.x
