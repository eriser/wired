==INTRODUCTION==
If you find any bug or if you have any difficulties using Wired, please follow 
the foolowing steps.
1- Go to the "KNOWN BUGS" section of this document and check if yours is present.
   Instructions will be given there
2- Visit the user forum (http://bloodshed.net/wired/userforum) and search for a 
   post concerning your problem, it may already be discussed.
3- If nobody has already talked about it, please start a new thread in the 
   appropriate forum, you'll be answered soon.


==COMMON USAGE PROBLEMS==
1- "You may check for your audio settings..."

First, you should check you audio settings... ;-)
To do so, in the menu 'Edit', choose 'Settings...'. Then go to the Audio section.
In the Output subsection, choose a sound card, make sure two outputs are checked.
Then go back to the main audio section and select a samplerate and a latency. 
The '4096 Samples/buffer' is known to be unstable on some configurations. 
Please, try to avoid it.

If it still doesn't work, or if you can't find any soundcard in the list, it may 
be because you are using ALSA and another software is already using your 
soundcard. Close every audio applications and try to relaunch wired.

You can try to use fuser to check if a command is using your audio devices.
$ fuser -v /dev/dsp
should make it in most cases, but you can replace /dev/dsp with the appropriate 
device, depending on your configuration. 



==KNOWN BUGS==
1- Session loading

When you try to load a session, Wired freezes.

This happens on some configurations, we are trying to understand why. As it does 
not occurs all the time, we have not been able to correct it efficiently. Please 
read this thread on the forum :
Instructions are given in the first post.

2- Multi track play

Wired can only play one track/instrument correctly, the others are scrambled.

Like the previous one, this bug hasn't been localized yet. We need your feedback 
to do so. Please read this thread on the forum : 
Instructions are given in the first post.
